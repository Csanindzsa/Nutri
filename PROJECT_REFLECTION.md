# Project Reflection: Building Nutri – A Learning Journey

Working on the Nutri project has been a transformative experience for us as students, both technically and personally. Nutri is a web-based platform designed to help users check restaurant food ingredients, assess dietary risks, and make informed choices about what they eat. The project combines a Django backend with a modern React TypeScript frontend, providing a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution to a real-world problem.

## What the Project Does

Nutri allows users to browse restaurant menus, view detailed ingredient lists, and check for dietary properties such as gluten-free, lactose-free, alcohol-free, and organic options. Supervisors can approve new foods and proposed changes, ensuring data quality and safety. The system also features a collaborative approval workflow, where multiple supervisors must approve changes before they take effect, increasing trust and transparency. Users can propose edits, request food removals, and even submit support tickets, making the platform interactive and community-driven.

## Why the Project Is Important

In today’s world, food allergies and dietary restrictions are increasingly common. Many people struggle to find reliable information about what’s in their food, especially when eating out. Nutri addresses this gap by providing a centralized, transparent database of restaurant foods and their ingredients. This empowers users to make safer, healthier choices and reduces the risk of accidental exposure to allergens or unwanted substances. For restaurants, Nutri offers a way to demonstrate transparency and build trust with customers. For supervisors and admins, the approval system ensures that only accurate, vetted information is published.

## What We Learned

### Technical Skills

- **Full-Stack Development:** We gained hands-on experience building both backend and frontend systems, learning how to design RESTful APIs, manage authentication with JWT, and handle complex data relationships in Django.
- **React & TypeScript:** Implementing the frontend taught us about component-based architecture, state management, hooks, and the benefits of static typing for maintainability and scalability.
- **UI/UX Design:** We learned to prioritize user experience, using Material UI for consistent, accessible, and visually appealing interfaces.
- **Testing & Debugging:** Writing and running tests, debugging issues across the stack, and handling edge cases improved our attention to detail and problem-solving skills.
- **Collaboration & Version Control:** Working as a team, we practiced using Git for version control, code reviews, and resolving merge conflicts, which are essential skills in any software development environment.

### Broader Lessons

- **Project Management:** Planning features, setting milestones, and adapting to changing requirements taught us about agile development and the importance of communication.
- **Security & Privacy:** Handling user data responsibly, implementing authentication, and considering security best practices were crucial aspects of the project.
- **Real-World Impact:** We saw firsthand how software can address real needs and improve people’s lives, motivating us to think beyond code and consider the broader implications of our work.

## Conclusion

Nutri is more than just a technical achievement; it’s a testament to our growth as students and aspiring developers. We learned to turn an idea into a working product, overcame challenges, and built something that can genuinely help people. The skills, knowledge, and confidence we gained will serve us well in our future careers, and we are proud of what we accomplished together.
